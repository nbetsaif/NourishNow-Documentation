### Overview
NourishNow is a mobile app developed using Flutter, an open-source UI toolkit from Google that enables developers to create applications for a variety of platforms, including Android, iOS, web, and desktop, from a single codebase. With NourishNow, users can access two distinct apps designed to help them manage their food delivery needs. And because the app is built with Flutter, users can enjoy a seamless, consistent experience across all their devices.
### User App
The app allows users to create an account and log in using their email address or with their Google account, so they can save their preferences and track their orders.
When users open the app, they can browse through a list of restaurants. Each one has its own menu, which users can view and customize to their liking. Users can also save their favorite items from each restaurant for quick access later on.
Users can also pick their delivery locations from the map in the app, making it easy to specify where they want their food to be delivered.
Once users have selected their items and delivery location, they can place their orders directly through the app. 
After placing their order, users can track its status in real-time through the app. They'll receive push notifications when their order is being prepared, when it's on its way, and when it's been delivered. This way, users can stay informed and plan their day accordingly.
### Admin App
When the admin logs in to the app, they can view and edit menus for all restaurants, add new items, set prices and descriptions,They can also set up promotions and discounts that apply across all restaurants.
Once an order is placed by a customer, the admin app receives a notification and displays the order details, including the delivery location and any special instructions. From there, the admin can assign the order to a restaurant and monitor its status until it is delivered to the customer.

### Flutter version
This project works with Flutter 3.7 (recommended version: 3.7.6 channel stable).
