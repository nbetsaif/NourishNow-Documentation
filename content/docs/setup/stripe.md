In the user app, we used Stripe to receive payment from costomers. To add payment with credit cards, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

2. Add your business details to activate your account.

3. Get your `merchant ID` and go to `Developers â†’ API` Keys and get your `publishable key` and your `secret key` and paste them in `project_configuration.dart` file.
