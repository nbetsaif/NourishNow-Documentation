## Setup
In the user app, we used Stripe to receive payment from costomers. To add payment with credit cards, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

2. Add your business details to activate your account.

3. Get your `merchant ID` and go to `Developers â†’ API` Keys and get your `publishable key` and paste them in `project_configuration.dart` file.


## Free plan setup
If you use free plan(Without cloud functions), you have to follow these steps:

1. Open `Without cloud functions/create-payment.js` and search for variable named `stripeSecretKey` and put your stripe secret key.

2. Search for variable named `firebaseProjectId` and put your firebase project id.

3. Go [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) and add the script.

4. Copy the link and paste it helpers/project_configuration.dart (variable name: stripePaymentApi).
