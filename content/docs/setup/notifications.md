For notifications between users and admin, we will use firebase messaging. So, we need the server key.

To get it, you have to go to Project settings â†’ Cloud messaging and copy the server id then paste it in lib/helpers/project_configuration.dart.

## Android
To change notification icon, go to `android/app/src/main/res/drawable` and replace `notification_logo.png` with yours (keep same file name).

## IOS
1. Generate the certificates required by Apple for receiving push notifications following this [guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs) in the Firebase docs. You can skip the section titled `Create the Provisioning Profile`.
2. In Xcode, select Runner in the Project Navigator. In the `Capabilities` Tab turn on `Push Notifications` and `Background Mode`s, and enable `Background fetch` and `Remote notifications` under `Background Modes`.
